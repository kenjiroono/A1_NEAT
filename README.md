# Evolving Artificial Neural Network using Evolutionary Strategy for a virtual robotic control
## Overview
This project uses [Python-NEAT](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) to evlolve ANN(artificial neural network) to solve cart-pole balancing task and to control [Unitree A1 robot](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/tree/main/unitree_a1) in [Mujoco physics simulator](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco).

[OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) is together used with Mujoco to construct the custom reinforcement learning environment for robotic control task.
