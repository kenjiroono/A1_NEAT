# Evolving Artificial Neural Network using Evolutionary Strategy for a virtual robotic control
## Overview
This project uses [Python-NEAT](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) to evlolve ANN(artificial neural network) to solve cart-pole balancing task and to control [A1 robot](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/tree/main/unitree_a1) in [Mujoco physics simulator](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco).


This project consists of Unitree A1 robot mujoco-gym environment, NEAT-python implementation.
