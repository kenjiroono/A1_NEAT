# Evolving Artificial Neural Network using Evolutionary Strategy for a virtual robotic control
## Overview
This project uses Python-NEAT to evlolve ANN(artificial neural network) to solve cart-pole balancing task and to control robot in Mujoco physics simulator.


This project consists of Unitree A1 robot mujoco-gym environment, NEAT-python implementation.
